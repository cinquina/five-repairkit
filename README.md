# 5️⃣ five-repairkit
Before starting, all the credits goes to the original repository [made by MaximilianAdF](https://github.com/MaximilianAdF/NoPixel-MiniGames-4.0), we have **not** developed the UI of this resource but we only added the integration to use it on **FiveM**.
This resource is completely **standalone** so there's no required framework for this script.
